    Obsolete the <param> element
    
    Given that plugins are gone from the web platform (with their full removal from the spec being tracked in #6003), it is not useful. In some browsers it can be used to figure out the URL of an <object>, even when that <object> is not being used for a plugin, via params named "movie", "src", "code", or "url". But we decided to remove this behavior from browsers instead of specifying it.
    
    This retains the HTMLParamElement interface, as well as the parser behavior of <param>.
    
    Closes #387. Helps with #6003.

    Avoid suggesting the empty string for navigator.platform
    
    navigator.platform was permitted to return the empty string due to a privacy-motivated spec change in ecefa6e105592656bf592e0abcf0276dad971fbc.
    
    Since 2008, the understanding of changing things like this for privacy has evolved from returning special privacy values to returning a value that is already commonly returned for non-privacy reasons. Therefore, change the spec not to say "the empty string" but to permit returning a string commonly returned on another platform.
    
    Additionally, change the examples to be from the set of values given at https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/ to avoid suggesting more-identifying and potentially-less-compatible values. But, for now, avoid actually constraining the permitted values to a reduced set.
    
    Further work on constraining these values is tracked mostly in https://github.com/whatwg/compat; see especially https://github.com/whatwg/compat/issues/174.

    Be more rigorous about insertion/removal
    
    Part of #2771. This removes the concepts of "node is inserted" and "node is removed" in favor of explicit HTML Standard insertion/removing steps, which are of the form the DOM Standard wants us to use. These HTML Standard insertion/removing steps, in turn, call out to element definition-specific "HTML element insertion/removing steps".
    
    This does not complete #2771, as there remain several less-rigorous definitions, outlined in https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2771#issuecomment-1074202744. But it gives us the right scaffolding and prevents any further usage of the node is inserted/removed definitions.

    It was confusing to have this as a generic on environment settings objects, since it only applied to window environment settings objects.

    Process preload Link headers
    
    Previously, Link header processing was almost entirely unspecified. This gives it a full processing model; currently it only processes preload Link headers, but in the future it can be extended to others. See #4224.
    
    Notably, this splits up processing of preload Link headers, some at document creation time, and the rest (viewport-dependent ones) when response chunks start arriving.

    Add allow-top-navigation-to-custom-protocols to sandbox=""
    
    For security reasons, web browsers started to block navigations toward custom protocols initiated from within a sandboxed iframe. They are allowed, only when normal navigations are already allowed in top-level frame and when opening new popups. See https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/7124 and https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2191#issuecomment-1006573881 for that background.
    
    It is hard for some websites to handle this change. They would like to not block custom schemes, while continuing to block supported ones. This adds a new "allow-custom-protocol-navigation" value for the sandbox="" attribute, which such sites can use.

    Editorial: completion reform for JavaScript AOs
    
    As part of the https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2547 the JavaScript specification has reformed how it deals with Completion Records, and thus what abstract operations can return. See https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/253#issuecomment-1050160672 for a brief description of when to use ? vs. ! vs. nothing at all.
    
    Additional minor fixes:
    
    * Replace uses of ObjectCreate (which no longer exists) with OrdinaryObjectCreate.
    * Replace "Rethrow any exceptions" with the ? syntax.
    * Use ? with GetFunctionRealm, which can throw due to revoked proxies.
